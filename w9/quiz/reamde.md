# Quiz application

You have to create a simple quiz website.

## Highlights

 -  The user is able to take a quiz
     -  Getting different questions, one at a time
     -  After selecting an answer, the correct answer is shown
     -  New question displays after the previous one is answered
 -  The user is able to add new questions by providing:
     -  a question
     -  4 possible answers
     -  marking the right answer
 -  The user is able to delete questions by ID

## Initialize a new project

 -  use `npm init`
 -  you'll need to set up `express` and `mysql` as dependencies (use `--save` command line flag to automatically add the packages to your package.json) 
 -  create `.gitignore` file for `node_modules` directory
 -  import the the MySQL database: [quiz_app.sql](data/quiz_app.sql)

## Frontend

The application consists of two screens.

### Game

![game](img/correct.png)

 -  It should display the question at the bottom
 -  It should have 4 buttons with the answers
 -  It should mark the right or wrong answer by clicking in it
 -  And it should get a new random question (use `setTimeout()` for that)
 -  It should show your current score
     -  First time it's 0, and every right answer increments it by one.
 -  It should have a link `manage questions` that points to `http://localhost:8080/questions` 

###  Manage questions

![questions](img/manage.png)

 -  It should show all the questions
 -  All questions should have a delete link
     -  Clicking on it deletes the question 
 -  It should have input fields below the questions:
     -  Question
     -  Answer 1
     -  Answer 2
     -  Answer 3
     -  Answer 4
 -  The answers should have radio buttons for marking the right answer
 -  And a submit button for sending the new question to your database
 -  It should have a link `go back to the game` that points to `http://localhost:8080/game`
