    Create a simple HTML document with one button.
    
    If the user clicks the button 3 times, 
    and 5 seconds is already elapsed since the page is loaded,
    a text should appear under the button:
    
    5 seconds elapsed and clicked 3 times
    
    If the user starts clicking before the first 5 seconds, 
    nothing should be printed
