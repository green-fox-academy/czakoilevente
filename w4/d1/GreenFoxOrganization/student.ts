/* Student
Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional
fields:

previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course methods:
getGoal(): prints out 'My goal is: Be a junior software developer.'
introduce(): 'Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the
 course already.'
skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
The Student class has the following constructors:

Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, 
skippedDays to 0
