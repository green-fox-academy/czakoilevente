#### Wiki: 

Google Cloud or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services 
that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products.
Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, 
data storage, data analytics and machine learning.

Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.


Overview from different aspects [in this guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/).

 Advantages of the service: 
  * Quickly build and deploy applications
  * Supports many popular languages like Java, PHP, Node.js, Python, C#, .Net, Ruby and Go 
    also you can bring your own language runtimes and frameworks of choice.
  * Automatic scaling-up and scaling-down of application.
  * Pay only for what you use - utomatic scaling based on application traffic and consumes resources only when your code is running
  
[On this page](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/) you can choose from tutorials based on your knowledge of language.
 
[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/) is about:
 * Choosing environment to suit your application
 * Set up environment to suit your programming language
 * Select region you wish to run your application in. Quite similar to AWS regions.
